<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[Visit the project](https://findyourwine.herokuapp.com)

Who doesn't know it - you're looking for the right wine for a balmy summer evening, a cozy dinner or a special occasion. But then you are completely overwhelmed by the diversity of the wine selection.
Find your Wine helps you find the perfect wine.

Here's how:
* You fill out a form describing some aspects of your perfect wine. 
* Based on your information, the algorithm matches your information with the vines in our database and determines the perfect wine variety for you.
* If you have a user account, you can also get the top 5 wine bottles from the database

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Installing and setting up the app locally._

1.Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:Haferkorn/Find-your-Wine.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```


#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
